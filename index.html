        <p>
          Juice WRLD was more than just a rapper — he was the voice of a
          generation. Through his raw emotion, honest lyrics, and genre-blending
          sound, he connected with millions across the world. Though his time
          was short, his impact remains eternal. “Legends Never Die” is not just
          the name of his album; it's a truth that lives on through his music,
          his message, and the hearts of his fans.
